## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Senaâ€”a current master's student at DePaul University pursuing a MS in Data Science with a concentration on computational methods. I previously graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a BA in Economics. My motivations are to understand various and vast industries by providing clarity through my curiosity. On my downtime, I enjoy picking up a good book, playing various racquet sports, being outdoors with mother nature, and playing with my Nintendo Switch. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about deep learning and neural networks, AI, machine learning, Power BI, and data science applications within the healthcare industry
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science and machine learning projects
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sbui1@depaul.edu or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/senabui/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I helped out with my family business for a few years before pursuing higher education. I place a large emphasis on community and expression!
